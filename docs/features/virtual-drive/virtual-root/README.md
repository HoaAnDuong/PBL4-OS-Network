# Virtual Root

The virtual root is a virtual folder that contains all other folders and files. It serves as the root directory for the virtual drive and is used as an access point in applications.

The default data for the virtual root is set in the `loadDefaultData()` function in the `VirtualRoot` class.

For more information about how the virtual root is stored and loaded, check the [Storage](../../storage/README.md) docs.
